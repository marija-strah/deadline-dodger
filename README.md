# Description
A classic 90s cross-the-road game inspired by my favourite childhood PC games.

The player's goal is to avoid obstacles.
If there is a collision, the game is over and the end screen appears.
If the player reaches the other side of the screen without touching
the obstacles, the win screen shows up.

Both the end and win screens allow the player to start over.

# Instructions
